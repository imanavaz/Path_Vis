\begin{abstract}
We present an interactive visualisation tool for recommending travel trajectories. 
This system is based on new machine learning formulations for the trajectory recommendation problem~\cite{chen2016learning,chen2017SR}. It is designed to explain structured predictions made by several new algorithms, and to assist comparative visual analysis of different candidate trajectories. 
One challenge for visualizing the properties of a structured object such as a trajectory is to present and compare information from a large number of modalities. We tackle this challenge by breaking down contributions from different geographical and user behavior features, and also separating contributions from individual points-of-interest, and those involving two consecutive points on a route. The system also supports detailed quantitative interrogation by comparing a large number of features for two or more points. 
Trajectory visualisation can potentially benefit any user of online maps by increasing transparency on machine-learning algorithms and assist decision-making.  More broadly, the design of this system can inform visualisations of other structured prediction tasks, such as for sequences or trees. 
% While routing and location recommendation has been extensively explored in research and commercially available systems, 
%
%We propose a novel travel route visualisation tool to help an interaction between tourists and route recommendation system. 
%While the route recommendation algorithm shows promising results in a laboratory setup on benchmark dataset, the process of recommendation is still invisible to end-users who would benefit the information used to recommend the routes. 
%Based on a structured prediction algorithm tailored for the route recommendation, we propose a route visualisation which aims to reduce the gap between the end-users and recommendation system by visualising recommendation scores on various attributes of the suggested routes.
